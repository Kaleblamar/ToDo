# ToDo
This code is a to-do list app written in JavaScript that uses HTML and CSS. It allows users to add new to-do items, mark them as completed, delete them, and clear completed items. The app also includes animations and local storage functionality to persist the user's completed to-do items even if the browser is closed.
The app is created using the Document Object Model (DOM) API, which allows JavaScript to manipulate the HTML and CSS of a webpage. It creates event listeners for the add, completed, and delete buttons, as well as for the input field for adding new to-do items. When the user adds a new to-do item, the app creates a new list item and adds it to the to-do list, along with an input radio button and a trash can button. The input radio button allows the user to mark the item as completed, which moves it to a separate completed tasks list and adds a slide-up animation to the item. The trash can button allows the user to delete the item from the to-do list, and a separate clear completed button allows the user to delete all completed tasks from the completed tasks list.
The app uses local storage to persist the user's completed to-do items. When the user marks an item as completed, the app saves the item to an array and stores the array in local storage using JSON. When the app loads, it retrieves the array from local storage and creates a new list item for each completed to-do item.
Overall, this code provides a simple but functional to-do list app with basic functionality and animations.
